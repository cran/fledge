What you need to do in practice is:

- Add a hyphen `-` or `*` at the beginning of important commit messages e.g. the merge or squash commits that merge a Pull Request. These are the commit messages that'll be recorded in the changelog eventually! Exclude housekeeping parts of the message by typing them after a line `---`.

```text

- Add support for bla databases.

```

or 

```text

- Add support for bla databases.

Also tweak the CI workflow accordingly. :sweat_smile:

```

For informative commit messages refer to the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html).

- Run `fledge::bump_version()` regularly e.g. before every coffee break or at the end of the day or of the week. If you forgot to merge one PR run `fledge::unbump_version()`, merge the PR with an informative squash commit message, then run `fledge::bump_version()` and go drink that coffee!

- Run `fledge::finalize_version()` if you add to edit `NEWS.md` manually e.g. if you made a typo or are not happy with a phrasing after thinking about it. Even if you edit a lot, what's been written in by fledge is still a good place-holder.

- Follow the recommended steps at release (see `vignette("fledge")` usage section).

These habits are worth learning!
