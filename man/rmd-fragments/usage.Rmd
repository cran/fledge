The following sections show how to combine these functions at different stages with any R package on GitHub.
All {fledge} commands should be issued from the package directory of the target R package.

### Initial Configuration

{fledge} assumes that the target R package is version-controlled with Git in a dedicated repository.
The following steps are required to set up {fledge} for first time use, with your package.

1. Call `bump_version()` as given below to set the package version

    ```
    fledge::bump_version()
    ```

2. Edit `NEWS.md` if required (typo fixes, rephrasing, grouping).    

3. Call `finalize_version()` as given below to update `NEWS.md`

    ```
    fledge::finalize_version()
    ```

You are all set to switch to the development stage now.
Ensure that you use bullet points (`*` or `-`) in your commit or merge messages to indicate the messages that you want to include in `NEWS.md`.
Use `finalize_version(push = TRUE)` to push to the remote repository (e.g. GitHub) in one swoop.


### Development

{fledge} aims to update `NEWS.md` and `DESCRIPTION` correctly whenever a new version is assigned.
In order to do this, the following steps need to be included throughout the development workflow.

1. In commit messages to your main branch (typically `main` or `master`), mark everything that should go to `NEWS.md` with a bullet point (`-` or `*`).
    This is applicable to single commits, merge commits, or squash commits from pull requests.
    Do not edit `NEWS.md` manually.

2. When you want to assign a version number to the current state of your R package e.g. at the end of the day or before a break, call

    ```r
    fledge::bump_version()
    ```

    The default argument for bump_version is "dev". So the dev part of the version number will be updated.
    It is good practice to assign a new version number before switching focus to another project.

3. Edit `NEWS.md` if required (typo fixes, rephrasing, grouping).

4. Call `finalize_version()`: `fledge::finalize_version()`. This achieves the following:
    - `NEWS.md` is now composed, based on the most recent commit messages.
            To understand how `NEWS.md` is updated by fledge, see the section on `NEWS.md` implementation.
    - A new version number is assigned automatically (this is modeled after `usethis::use_version()`).
    - A tag matching the version number is assigned automatically, with the most recent `NEWS.md` messages included in the tag's message.

### Releasing to CRAN

When you want to release your package to CRAN, follow the steps below:

1. Call bump_version() with the appropriate argument (`"patch"`, `"major"`, `"minor"`). e.g.,

    ```r
    fledge::bump_version("patch")
    ```

2. Edit `NEWS.md`, convert the "change log" to "release notes" -- a higher-level description of features and bug fixes (typo fixes, rephrasing, grouping).

3. Call `commit_version()` as below

    ```r
    fledge::commit_version()
    ```

4. Make any necessary adjustments before releasing to CRAN depending on results of preparatory / incoming checks.

5. Once the release/changes have been accepted by CRAN, use the following calls to tag the released version and to switch to a development version immediately.

    ```
    fledge::tag_version()
    fledge::bump_version()
    ```

6. Return to development mode!
